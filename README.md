Fake Account Detection on Instagram

Description

This project implements a machine learning model to detect fake social media accounts on Instagram. Using user features and engagement metrics, the model predicts whether an account is genuine or fake.

SVM ALGORITHM:
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. In this project, SVM plays a crucial role in distinguishing between real and fake accounts based on extracted Instagram features.


Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Setup

Clone this repository:

Check accuracy and classification metrics for results.

Dataset

The dataset contains Instagram account features such as:

Number of followers

Number of following

Post count

Engagement rate

Source: Custom dataset (or specify if using a public dataset)

Model & Approach

Machine Learning Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
